#### LRU-Simulator

implementation procedures for four kinds of lru(stack, counter, arb, second_chance) by python

Hello, welcome to my github.

First of all, this project borrows from @Tony Poerio [https://github.com/adpoe/Page-Replacement-Simulator](https://github.com/adpoe/Page-Replacement-Simulator)ï¼Œa 2016 project, I mainly used his framework, but realized different algorithms.

####  Usage

In the python2 environment, you can also modify parts of the code to run under python3

```
Usage:  
python lrutest.py -n <numframes> -a <counter|stack|arb|second_chance> <tracefile>
```
